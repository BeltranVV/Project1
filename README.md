__Hypothesis:__  Counties with higher migration flows and high population density will exhibit higher infection rates of COVID-19.

__Goal of this analysis:__ Investigate the relationship between migration rates, population density, and COVID-19 infection rates, aiming to determine if a statistically significant correlation exists. Additionally, to identify counties or factors where the relationship appears to be particularly strong, providing insights into the impact of migration and population density on COVID-19 infection rates at a local level.
* __Measurement:__ Infection rate
* __F1:__ Migration gross flow
* __F2:__ Population density
