__Regression tools applied for COVID data analysis__

This repository contains an investigation into the relationship between migration rates, population density, and COVID-19 infection rates at a county level. The primary objective is to determine if a statistically significant correlation exists between these variables. 

## Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the factors contributing to the spread of the virus at a local level. Two key variables of interest are migration rates and population density, as they may impact the transmission and infection rates of the virus. This investigation delves into the data to better understand the relationships between these variables.

## Data Sources

The investigation uses data from:

- COVID-19 infection rates by county obtained from: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties-recent.csv
- Migration flow data, obtained from: [CENSUS.gov](https://www.census.gov/)
- Population density data, obtained from: https://covid19.census.gov/

## Methodology

The investigation employs various statistical methods, including:

- Linear regression analysis
- Hypothesis testing
- Data visualization

The goal is to determine the statistical significance of the relationships between migration rates, population density, and COVID-19 infection rates.

## Results

The data was categorized based on population density, classifying the data into three categories with an equal number of data points to ensure that each group was representative. Additionally, the logarithm of the data was taken to normalize the distribution. Also, the logarithm of the data was taken to normalize the distribution.
