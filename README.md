__Regression tools applied for COVID data analysis__

This repository contains an investigation into the relationship between migration rates, population density, and COVID-19 infection rates at a county level. The primary objective is to determine if a statistically significant correlation exists between these variables. 

## Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the factors contributing to the spread of the virus at a local level. Two key variables of interest are migration rates and population density, as they may impact the transmission and infection rates of the virus. This investigation delves into the data to better understand the relationships between these variables.

## Data Sources

The investigation uses data from:

- COVID-19 infection rates by county obtained from: 
- Migration flow data, obtained from:
- Population density data, obtained from: 

## Methodology

The investigation employs various statistical methods, including but not limited to:

- Linear regression analysis
- Hypothesis testing
- Data visualization

The goal is to determine the statistical significance of the relationships between migration rates, population density, and COVID-19 infection rates.

## Key Findings

This section will be updated with the key findings of the investigation as they become available.

## Conclusions
